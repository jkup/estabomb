Estabomb
========

This project will provide a simple to run group estimation planning system.

Too often developers lose their nerve to give a correct estimate because someone else over or under estimates
wildly. Using this tool, you can help prevent that from happening, as nobody will see the other's estimates
until all estimates have been entered.

Setup
-----

To set up the project to test, there are two steps:

- `npm install` will get the dependencies (including automatically running bower install)
- `node app.js` will start the server you need to see it work.

After that, open `web/index.html` in your browser and you can start to see things working!
